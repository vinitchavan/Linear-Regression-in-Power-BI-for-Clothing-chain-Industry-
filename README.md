# Linear-Regression-in-Power-BI-for-Clothing-chain-Industry


A targeted marketing campaign needs to be created for a national clothing chain. The need for this has arisen due to flat sales and lost customers. The company wants to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations.

The company is looking for data driven decision making to target the appropriate customer base. This report is a data driven analysis to find the best product to advertise to each customer.

In this report we have created a regression report, but before that we have calculated Correlation factor between Customer income and sales which is 0.88 and R2 correlation value is 0.78. It means If income of a customer is more then sales is also increased. It is highly positively correlated with each other.
Correlation value between rating and return rate is -0.83 and R2 correlation value is 0.69. It means five-star rating product has least chance of returning as return rate and ratings are negatively correlated with each other. 

Then we created a Regression table using state and sales and added income. We take X is as our sales and Y is our income then formula becomes y = mx + b.

All the aalysis is done in Microsoft Power BI.
